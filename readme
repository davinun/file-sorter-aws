Todo:
-------
--> S3 File generator and Range reader
--> API Gateway + Lambda to generate the file
- Lambda S3 Splitter
- SQS Writer
- SQS Reader

- create SNS and SQS on the fly

Limitations and Points to Improve
----------------------------------
- Only one sort can run at any time. In order to support multiple sorts --> create SQS and SNS on the fly and delete them at the end.
- Delete temporary files
- The Merge-Consumer Lambda runs for as long as the whole sorting process runs - most of the time waiting on the queue of files to sort.
- Break MyFileLambda to separate classes and possibly separate modules with minimum dependency
- Make things more configurable in general

Ponder:
--------
File format - a binary DataStream in the format double,double,double,...

double = 8 bytes
char = 2 bytes

1GB file ==> 1,000 million bytes ==> 100,000,000 numbers in the file

Use SNS to invoke the Lambda
SQS - using polling only - cannot invoke Lambda
